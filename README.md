# Linja Game with Minimax Algorithm in Python

## Description
This project implements a reduced version of the game **Linja** in Python. The main objective of this project was to implement the **Minimax algorithm** for decision-making in two-player games. Linja is a strategy game where players aim to align their pieces on a grid, and the Minimax algorithm helps in evaluating the best moves for optimal play.

This project was completed during the third year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, for the subject **Artificial Intelligence Systems**.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Implement the **Minimax algorithm** for strategic game play.
- Understand and apply concepts of game theory and decision-making in AI.
- Develop a simplified version of Linja to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness.

## Features
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm for game decision-making.
- Reduced version of the Linja game with a simple interface.
- Python code demonstrating game logic and AI.

## Technologies Used
- Python Programming Language
- Minimax Algorithm
